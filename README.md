# Covid-19-project
In this project I work with Covid-19 data provided by John Hopkins University. 
After data manipulation and cleaning I create interactive maps which show the
number of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries across the globe. Several bar
charts and treemaps are provided as well. 

I also trained three machine learning algorithms to estimate the spread of the
virus in the nearest future. The three algorithms that I used are linear
regression, polynomial regression, and SVM. It is a highly nontrivial task to 
predict the spread of covid and in order to give accurate estimates for certain 
region one has to take into account many factors, such as strictness of
restrictions in that region, season and many others. So the ML part of my project 
is more an attempt to apply several ML algorithms to the real world problem rather 
than give accurate predictions for the spread of the virus.
